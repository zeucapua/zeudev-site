I've been learning web development on my own for the past few months and I've had plenty of fun. And while I'm confident
in my skills so far, there is a problem about being self-taught in the current state of modern javascript frameworks.
A lot of the tutorials online does not render what they are building in the tutorial itself for the user to interact with.

Video tutorials having this problem makes sense; it's a video. But blogs are a different story. And so I've made
the Ultimate Code Blog!

## What is the Point?

Coding blogs from independent developers to known repositories like w3schools have limited functionality.
When explaining code, most rely on lengthy explanations, which for the most part is warranted, and code snippets of
specific parts of the program. Showcases of the programs are either relegated to small HTML inputs or requires a
third-party embed like CodeSandbox.

Since I want to make my own tutorial coding blogs, I wanted markdown to make writing fast, while adding interactivity without
needing a third-party embed to run any showcases. Also easy page routing and responsive design. Here's where Astro comes in.

## What is Astro and MDX?

Astro is a "web framework for building fast, content-focused websites". Behind it is the idea that most or all pages
are rendered in straight HTML, while adding Javascript functionality using the Islands Architecture. This means that
you can opt into rendering javascript selectively in small parts of the website instead of wrapping the whole page in it.

This concept is important, especially when combined with native MDX support. MDX allow blogs like this to be written
just like a markdown file, while being able to inject HTML/Javascript components in between. As long as it is using Astro's
**client directive** to load the javascript and add a **not-prose** class to the component, it all works well! 
For example, here's a simple counter that could be found in Svelte's tutorial:

<Counter client:visible />

Now this component is created in Svelte, but the amazing thing about Astro is that you can create components using one of
their many UI framework integrations like React, Vue, or SolidJS.

## Better Code Snippets

With this framework, I'm able to make code snippets more beautiful and functional, in this case using Svelte components
with TailwindCSS and daisyUI CSS utility.

Markdown already has the ability to create simple code blocks like so:
```bash
> npm i daisyui
> installing...
! Error
```

While this is fine to use, to annotate specific parts of the code require either adding in-line comments, which makes the
snippet less readable, or explaining on a separate paragraph. Instead, I've made a custom component that highlights a
line with a collapsible annotation:

<CodeMockup>
  <MockupLine prefix="1" line="npm i daisyui" />
  <MockupLine prefix="2" line="installing..." tailwind="text-warning" />
  <MockupAnnotate prefix="3" line="Error" 
    annotation="This means that installing daisyUI didn't work!"
    lineTailwind="bg-error text-error-content"
    annotationTailwind="bg-error text-error-content"
  />
  <MockupLine prefix=">" line="Neat tool right?" />
</CodeMockup>

## Conclusion

There is a lot more experimentation to be had to learn what components are needed to create a better tutorial experience,
which is important as everyone from beginner to professional developers are reading these blogs everyday. If you have
any ideas as to how we can leverage Astro and MDX further to make tutorial hell a little more cool, please do let me know!
