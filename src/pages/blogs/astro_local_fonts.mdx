Astro is a web framework that aims to ship the least amount of Javascript. It allows people to
create static sites with the ability to create components with any of your favorite Javascript
UI frameworks like React and Svelte. This setup added with the native MDX integration that turns
markdown files to separate pages is the perfect frontend framework for blogging.

Now styling is important since it's one of the first things a visitor will see
about your site. Fonts come in to help make your text more beautiful and thankfully Astro
does have a section on their documentation on how to use a local font. Unfortunately, when
looking into integrating it with tailwindcss, you only get paragraph.

> If you are using the Tailwind integration, you can either add an **@font-face** statement for a local font or use Fontsource's 
> import strategy to register your font. Then, follow Tailwind's docs on adding custom font families.

I mean, yes that does explain it. But it's not very clear. So here is a tutorial on how to use local
fonts in Astro using tailwindcss.

## Project Structure
```
/ public
   └─ / fonts
      └─ / RadwaveFont_Demo.otf
/ src
   └─ / components
      └─ / GlobalStyles.astro
   └─ / pages
      └─ / index.astro
   └─ / layouts
      └─ / SiteLayout.astro
```



For this tutorial, I'm going to assume that you have...
1. an Astro project ready to go. If not, use their minimal starter project by doing `npm create astro@latest`.
2. the TailwindCSS integration installed. If not, install using `npx astro add tailwind` or `npm install @astrojs/tailwind tailwindcss`. Follow the rest of the setup guide [here](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/tailwind/).
3. a local font file to use. For this tutorial we will be using <a href="https://indieground.net/product/radwave-font/" target="_blank">Radwave Font from Indieground Design</a>.

The goal here to import the font into a style tag, which will be inside the `GlobalStyles.astro` 
file, which will be referenced in a layout that will wrap every page, 
therefore allowing accessing to the font. We will then use tailwindcss' arbitrary 
values option when styling a text element.


## Move the Font in Position
Now there are multiple ways of adding a font into a web project, like installing an npm package,
but for now, we'll focus on using a local font that will live inside your source code. In this
case, we will the font into the public folder. For my case, I also put it into a separate fonts
folder to keep things neat and tidy.


## Using `@font-face` to Install Font
Next is to create the `GlobalStyles.astro` file inside a components folder under src.
Inside we will install the tailwind directives and the font using `@font-face`

```astro
<style is:global>
  @tailwind base;
  @tailwind components;
  @tailwind utilities;

  @font-face {
    font-family: 'Radwave';
    src: url('/fonts/RadwaveFont_Demo.otf');
    font-weight: normal;
    font-style: normal;
    font-display: swap;
  }

  ...
</style>
```

Astro has a built in `is:global` directive for any style tags inside an Astro component. This
in theory is enough to have the font usable throughout the website, but putting this in any
component is not sufficient. So to mitigate this, we will reference this file inside a layout.

## Creating a Global Layout

Layouts in Astro allow the developer to use the same basic template across multiple pages.
Any HTML, CSS, or Javascript that you want in every page (like a navigation bar) can be put in
a layout and then in each page, create an element from that layout and code inside. With that
said, let's make this `SiteLayout.astro` file.

```astro
---
import GlobalStyles from "../components/GlobalStyles.astro"
---
<html>
  <head>...some code</head>
  <body>
    <slot />
    ...some code
  </body>
</html>
```

Here we can see two things, the import and slot tag. In Astro, any imports have to go inside
a code fence (`---`), which was directly inspired by Markdown's frontmatter (just a fun fact).
Since we are importing the `GlobalStyles.astro` file into a layout that will be used sitewide,
that means that the font declaration is able to be used. 

The other thing to look at is the slot tag. It (`<slot />`) is where anything wrapped inside this
component. That means any pages to be made will have its content inside the the layout's tags.
So let's put it all together and finally we get to use tailwind!

## Using Astro Layouts and TailwindCSS for Local Font

For this tutorial we are only using one page, `index.astro`, and one p tag. This should work on multiple
pages as long as you use the `SiteLayout` to wrap your content in and <u>**make sure that you are using the correct path**</u>.
* If for instance you have page in `src/pages/blogs/index.astro`, import using `../../layouts/SiteLayout.astro`.

Let's make this page! See how the page's content, in this case a `<p>` tag saying hello. That's
what's the `<slot />` tag is substituing for in the `SiteLayout.astro` file. And here we finally
get to use tailwindcss. 

```astro
---
import SiteLayout from "../layouts/SiteLayout.astro"
---
<SiteLayout>
  <p class="font-['Radwave']">Hello!</p>
</SiteLayout>
```

What to pay attention to here is the use of tailwindcss' arbitrary property in styling for the font family.
Every tag that you want to change the font of will need to use this and making sure it is the
same name as the **font-family** inside the `@font-face` declaration earlier.

## Conclusion

And that's it! Now you have a functional website with local fonts enabled to be used via
tailwindcss. If you've made it this far, thank you so much for reading my tutorial. Read more

day better, even if it's by a tiny bit.
